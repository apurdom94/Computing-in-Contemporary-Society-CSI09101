## Definition - Ethics (noun, pl) ##

- Oxford English Dictionary:
  - "The science of morals.. the department of study concerned with the principles of human duty"
  - "The moral principles of a school of thought"
  - The moral principles by which a person is guided
  - The rules of conduct recognised in certain associations or departments of human life
- A theoretical examination of morality (Kizza, 2017)

## Why Examine Computer Ethics ##

- It is agreed that technology is changing many aspects of human life
- What are disputed are the social end ethical implications of these changes and the ways in which one can conceptualise and interpret the tech/society interrelationship
- At the centre of this interrelationship we can find many complex questions about the nature of human agency, autonomy and freedom
- Tech developers, mainly 'Big Tech' have been criticised for:
  - lacking empathy
  - lacking a sense of responsibility regarding the social problems that their technologies have created or made worse
- Decisions made by tech corporations have negatively impacted society's capacity for:
  - civil dialogue
  - privacy
  - fairness ....

## Computer Ethics ##

- "The growth of the internet and social networks; the ability to capture, store, and analyse vast amounts of personal data; and a greater reliance on information systems in all aspects of life, have increased the risk that information technology will be used unethically. In the midst of the many IT breakthroughs in recent years, the importance of ethics and human values has been under-emphasised —with a range of consequences.”  (Reynolds, 2018). 
- The mark of a problem in computer ethics is one in which computer technology is essentially involved and there is uncertainty about what to do and even about how to understand the situation (Moor, 1985). 
- Moor also argued that computers show up policy vacuums that require new thinking and the establishment of new policies
- There is a cultural anxiety which surrounds new technology (Baym, 2015)
- Technology has become thought of as a default means to solve a whole raft of technical and social problems such as health, security and governance etc
- Technology is to a great extent synonymous with society's view of modernisation and progress
- Using mobile phones it is discussed by (Baym, 2015) that technological innovation takes two forms:
  - to express concerns (the communication is shallow, or that mediated communications threatens the sanctity of personal relationships)
  - to welcome opportunity (for more connection with more people, leading to stronger and more diverse relationships)
- Before technology becomes so normalised as to be invisible the **time of flux** is the time for critical thinking
- As predicted by Moor (1985) every new technology creates a moral vacuum into which commentators pour their views
- Baym (2015) calls them Utopian vs Dystopian perspectives - either doom laden where the innovation is totally evil or evangelical where it is completely wonderful

### What questions should be asked? ###

- Who stands to benefit from a particular technology? 
- Who stands to suffer under it? 
- Whom might it empower? 
- Whom might it oppress?

## Technology Neutrality - it's "just a tool" ##

- The most common view of computer technology is that it is just a tool available which we choose to use or not to use in order to support humans to reach goals or outcomes, similar to how a tradesman would use a drill vs screwdriver
- Researchers argue against this theory because in comparison to a tradesman's tools digital technologies can sometimes make decisions for themselves (Danks, 2022)
- Autonomous and semi-autonomous technology "typically have the capability to plan, decide and act in the world. These systems make ethical choices, sometimes matters of life or death, for example in the military or self-driving cars (Danks, 2022)
  
## Power Abstracted by Technology ##

- Technology can distance developers and users perceptually from the consequences of their action (Peterson, Ferreira & Vardi, 2023)
- The authors define abstracted power as "a human actors influence or control over a system, process or dataset which, as a function of the technology that enables it, obscures or distances the human actor from consequences of the influence or control"
- "The emotional consequences ... are obscured by a technological intermediary - a joystick, lever, keyboard or UI (p. 96)
- They contend that consequences still occur, but at a remove, so the human may find them easier to dismiss

## Technological Intermediation and Computational Thinking ##

- Perterson et al (2023), argue that **technological intermediation** and **computational thinking** are two factors inherent in computer science that contribute to distancing 
- Technological intermediation means that technologies have changed to allow greater opacity between tech developers and their users - they are huge, faceless, global corporations with subtle but enormous influence
- Computational thinking trains computing students and developers to think in abstractions (variables, data types, algorithms), not emotional or social impacts or messy, unpredictable humans


## Technological Determinism ##

- The most common view on computer technology is that it is a tool to support humans in achieving their objectives and outcome. It can be used or not used
- Technological determinism or technological constructivism is the view that technology appears and more or less causes certain ways of doing activities and process
  - for example - the question "What impact does twitter have on political discourse" assumes that twitter has a determinate effect (obeys the laws of causality)
- Technological determinism assumes an inevitable, one directional relationship between technology and society

## Social Determinism (Actor-Network Theory) ##

- Social determinism proposes that a complex network of human relations, connections and action alone shapers technology
- Actor-Network Theorists favour the term network because it implies no hierarchy, no a priori order relation and no permanence in relationship
- Difficulty arises when, in its efforts to avoid a single explanatory trajectory for technological innovation, it treats all elements in the network of actors as equal, describes phenomena rather than explaining them and fails to identify significant factors or agents in the network
  
## Social Shaping of Technology ##

- This can be seen as a more neutral or balanced approach between technological determinism and the actor network theory
- Baym (2015) proposes that technology affects society by affordances, constrains, preconditions and unintended consequences
  - Affordances - technology makes tasks easier in our life
  - Constraints - make (some) tasks harder
  - Preconditions limit who can use technology and how
  - Unintended consequences are unintended impacts

## Practical Ethics ## 

- Practical ethics deals with individuals or groups making decisions that have future impacts, either good or bad
- There may be personal uncertainties and conflicts of opinion, for example:
  - Is is better to use tech in this way or that?
  - Have we thought about it's impact?
  - Just because something has always happened does that make it right?
- Ethics therefore requires that we decide on what is right or wrong in any given situation in order to decide on the action that should be taken
