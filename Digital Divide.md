## Global Divide ##

- "The perceived gap between those who have and do not have access to 'information tools' and between those who have and do not have the ability to use those tools" (Tavani, 2016)
- The divide has been described as "notoriously muddy" implying that the gap is troubling (Rooks and Weckert, 2007)
- There is many divides which are spoken about, they consit of both internally (eg Inverness vs Edinburgh) and internationally (UK vs Sudan)
- These divides can also be put down to things such as wealth, education, disability and gender. 

## Internet Usage ##

- 10% increase in internet use each year between 2005-2019
- Rising trend hides the increase in inequality between developed and less developed nations
- 96% without the use of internet are living in a developing county
- 5.3 billion online vs 2.7 billion offline in 2022

## Trends in Global Internet Use ##

- Growth of internet use was steady but numbers rose considerably between 2020-2021, known as the pandemic boost but this was short lived. 
- The inequality between developed and less developed means that some users can rarely access the internet. This can be down to a number of things such as:
  - Poor conectivity
  - Slow speeds
  - Intermitant access to electricty
  - Access to the internet is more expensive in poportion to earnings
- The digital gender gap is also growing within developing countries

### The Pandemic Boost ###

- It is estimated that the number of people who have used the internet increased to 4.9 bil in 2021 (53.6% of the global population) from 4.1 bil in 2019
- The sharp increase was due to a change in the ways we worked during the pandemic with employers and educatiors looking to move online. 
- The gap still remained in place with a comparrison between urban (82%) and rural (46%) areas. Rural users still tended to have much poor speeds - this is the case in mainland Europe as well

### The Digital Gender Gap ###

- Men (62%) use the internet more in comparisson to women (57%). When scaled this means that the divide is 17%.
- The gap is smaller in developed countries (88% vs 89%) when compared to less developed countries (19% vs 31%) 
- In 8% of countries women use the internet more than men
- In Arab States, Asia and Africa the gender gap contiues to grow


## Barries to Internet Usage ##

- One key barrier to the use of the internet is the lack of IT skills
- In 40/84 countries less than half the population prossesses basic computer skills such as copying a file or sending an email with an attatchment 
- Numbers were even lower when examining 'standard skills' such as basic maths formuala in excel or downloading and installing new software

## Internet Speeds ##

- Average global broadband download speed was 9.10Mbps (30th May 17 - 29th May 18)
- Average speed measured from 9 May 2018 to 8 May 2019 was 11.03Mbps 
- Average speed in 2020 was 24.83 Mbps (first pandemic year)
- Average speed in 2021 was 29.79 Mbps 
- Average speed in 2022 was 35.98 Mbps 
- Latest average global broadband speed in 2023 is 46.79 Mbps

#### The fastest and slowest countries for broadband speed (2023)

- The slowest speeds are seen in developing countries (reason)
- Faster are in the developed world (reason)

## Benifits of Digital Skills (Lloyds Bank Survey) ##

- 99% of people in the UK have used the internet in some capacity in the last three months. 
- 13% (6.8 million) fall into the catagoty of lowest digital capacity (struggle interacting online). These people are at risk of being left behind. 
- 2020-2023 the number with the highest digital capacity rose from 6.5 mil to 14.1 mil - likley due to more people using the internet due to the pandemic
- Since start of pandemic 65% of those online tried something new online such as shopping, bills and work from home
- The survey (2022) indicates that 17% of UK population cannot undertake basic "Foundation digital activities" like turning on a device, connecting to Wi-Fi, changing passwords or opening an app
- The unemployed are twice as likley than the employed to lack digital skills - likely because a workplace will expose people to technology through things such as online learning, applying for AL however. Catch 22 - cant get job without basic computer skills but cant build them without a job
- Offline members of the population will struggle to access public services such as the NHS, goverment services and financial service- The most digitaly capabale have saved on averahe £659 a year through online banking

## Digital Engagement in the UK ##

  - In Feb 2020 96& of households in GB had internet access, this is an increase from 2019 (93%) and 2006 (57%)
  - The generation gap between older and younger users is narrorinw but age is still a good indicator of if people are online (Lloyds, 2023)
  - People with an impairment are 25% less likely to have the skills to access devieces and get online themselves.

## Digital Skills Example - Universal Credit ##

- Unversal Credit replaced various benifits having one thing to claim for to make it easier
- It can only be claimed online
- This is an example of "Digital by Default"
- Newspapers cited hardship owning to digital exclusion and long waits
- Some charties offer basic online skills training, this is also provided in libararies across Scotland

## Age and Digitial Exclusion - UK Example (Hu abd Qian, 2021) ##

- Older people who only had virtual contact during lockdowns experinced greater loneliness and faced negitive mental health issues than older people who had no contact with others
- Older people tend to be unfamiliar with technology and found it so stressful to learn how o use thus it was more damaging to their mental ealth than simply coping with the isolation
