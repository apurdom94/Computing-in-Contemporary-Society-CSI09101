## Practical Ethics -> Theories of Ethics ##

- We must connect the principle or value to a particular situation and consider arguments for various courses of action or decisions
- The dialectic method examines situations to discover their underlying ethical issues
- This creates a kind of socratic dialogue (though Socrates did it through questioning)
- When we realise what the ethical problem is, there is different perspectives or traditions of ethical through we can use to decide what is the right or moral course of action

## Traditions of Ethical Thought - Rule based ethics ## 

- In this tradition, bad actions can be avoided by following a set of rules, for example the ten commandments
  - You shall have no other gods before Me
  - You shall make no idols
  - You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain
  - Keep the Sabbath day holy
  - Honour your father and your mother
  - You shall not murder
  - You shall not commit adultery
  - You shall not steal
  - You shall not bear false witness against your neighbour
  - You shall not covet
- It is difficult to generals these ancient rules to the complex ethical problems which occurs in the modern world
- On what moral basic would we devise rules for new situations
  - Is it right to intercept an email?
  - Is using a drone to drop bombs "better"?

## Consequentialist Schools of Ethical Thought ##

- These can also be known as teleological theories as they consider the consequences of an action as a measure of goodness
- This is a contrast to deontological theories, which emphasise the rightness of an action above the goodness it produces
- In Consequentialism, the right action is understood entirely in terms of the consequences it produces. It can be split into three sub categories
  - Utilitarianism
  - Altruism
  - Egoism
- Utilitarianism is the most important originated in 18th century philosophers David Hume and Francis Hutcheson
- David Hume rejected religion in favour of basing moral judgements on consequences and proof rather than intuition and conscience, in this respect ethics is an extension of empiricism
- If an act is vicious, its viciousness is a matter of the observable human response to the act
- "That action is best, which procures the greatest happiness for the greatest numbers (Hutcheson, 1725) - the test or criterion of right action is its tendency to promote the general welfare of mankind
- Hutcheson anticipated the Utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham and not only the principle, but even in the use of the phrase "the greatest happiness for the greatest number"

### Unitarism ###

- Jeremy Bentham was an English philosopher and arguably the greatest proponent of Utilitarianism
- Utilitarianism evaluates actions based on the consequences for overall happiness and the good the action provides rather than the action itself
- "Actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote the greatest pleasure or happiness" (John Stuart Mill, 1863)
- Utilitarianism is also distinguished by impartially and agent-neutrality - Everyone's happiness counts the same, my goof counts for no more or less than anyone else's good

### Egoism ###

- The theory puts an individuals interest above every other consideration
- Ethical egoism claims "I morally ought to perform some action if, and only if, and because, performing that action maximises my self-interest" 
- Any action is good as long as it maximises an individuals happiness
- What distinguishes it from Utilitarianism is the scope of the relevant consequences. In the Utilitarianism view one ought to maximise the overall good and treat everyone good the same

### Altruism ###

- The action is right if it favours all apart from the actor
- Altruistic acts need not involve self sacrifice and they remain altruistic even when performed from a mixture of motives
- **Reciprocal** altruists display behaviour towards those from whom they have received it or from whom they expect to receive
- **Universal** altruism often seen as the central ethical prescription of Christianity is unconditional 


### Deontology ###

- Derives from the Greek term 'deon' which translates to duty
- Stresses duties, rights and ethics of actions
- Examines whether an action is morally right or wrong in itself, irrespective of its consequences
- Importance is attached to the motive of a decision
- Immanuel Kant a German philosopher is the most important for deontological or duty based ethics. 
- The sole feature that gives an action moral worth is not the outcome that is achieved by the action but the motive that is behind the action itself
- Within the domain of moral theories that assess our choices, deontologists stand in opposition to the consequentialists
- Kant is known for his theory that there is a single moral obligation, which he called the "Categorical Imperative"
- Kants categorical imperative is "always act out of the respect for the moral law"
- Categorical imperatives are principles that are intrinsically valid
  - they are good in and of themselves
  - they must be obeyed in all situations and circumstances if our behaviour is to observe the moral law

## Ethics in Practice ##

- Different societies, organisations and individuals have different moral values and espouse different ethical stances at different times
- There are few absolute rules
- Individual belief sets may be inherited from family, friends, workplace culture etc
- Therefore there is no absolutes eg "Ethical Relativism"
- The dialectic method does not always lead to a definitive conclusion about what should be done or what was wrong but almost always leads towards achieving objectivity and better understanding
